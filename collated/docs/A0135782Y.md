The _Sequence Diagram_ below show how recurring tasks are handled when they are first added by the user into Happy Jim Task Master. 

<img src="images/SD_add_recurring_tasks.png" width="600"><br>

> Note task is a Task reference from the Model and thus any changes made in the RecurringTaskManager will mutate the values of the task.

The _Sequence Diagram_ below show how recurring tasks have dates appended to them every startup of Happy Jim Task Master

<img src="images/SD_update_recurring_tasks.png" width="600"><br>

> Note that repeatingTasks is a reference to the UniqueTaskList from the TaskMaster. Any changes made to repeatingTasks in RecurringTaskManager will affect TaskMaster's version of UniqueTaskList.

The _Activity Diagram_ below shows the flow when a Task is being added in TaskMaster.

   > Note that dependency injection is used to ensure that only Task class is being tested.<br>
   > The rest of the stubs are injected into the dependencies for Task.<br>
   > This isolates Task from its dependencies and allows us to test only Task.
   
   **Integration tests**. Below are some snippets, <br>

   _RecurringTaskManagerTest.java_<br>
   <img src="images/integration_test_RecurringTaskManager.png" width="600"><br>
   
   > Note recurring manager is being tested if it is correctly wired to it dependency.
   > In this case the dependency is UniqueTaskList.

   > Note that dependency injection is used to isolate Task. 
   > Dependencies of Task is replaced with stubs that does nothing.
   > This allows us to test if UniqueTaskList works together with Task.

#### Adding a floating task : `add`
Adds a task to the todo list<br>
Format:`add TASK_NAME [t/TAG]...` 

Examples:
* `add Homework` 
* `add Homework t/CS1231` <br>
	<img src="images/ug_add_floating_before.PNG" width="600">
	<img src="images/ug_add_floating_after.PNG" width="600">

#### Adding a task with deadline : `add`
Format: `add TASK_NAME by DATE TIME [RECURRING_TYPE] [repeat REPEAT_PERIOD] [t/TAG]...`

> `RECURRING_TYPE` consists of daily, weekly, monthly and yearly case insensitive. 
> Tasks can have only 1 `RECURRING_TYPE`.
> If multiple `RECURRING_TYPE` are used, only the first instance will be accepted.
> `REPEAT_PERIOD` is the number of recurring task to be tracked
> If `REPEAT_PERIOD` is not entered as a number [repeat REPEAT_PERIOD] will be ignored

Examples: <br>
* `add Homework by 24 sep 8pm t/CS1231`
* `add Homework by 24 sep 6pm daily t/CS1231`
* `add Homework by 24 sep 7.15pm daily repeat 4 t/CS1231`

	<img src="images/ug_add_by_date_after.PNG" width="600">

#### Adding a task with start time and end time : `add`
Format: `add TASK_NAME from DATE TIME to DATE TIME [RECURRING_TYPE] [repeat REPEAT_PERIOD] [t/TAG]...`

> `RECURRING_TYPE` consists of daily, weekly, monthly and yearly case insensitive. 
> Tasks can have only 1 `RECURRING_TYPE`.
> If multiple `RECURRING_TYPE` are used, only the first instance will be accepted.
> `REPEAT_PERIOD` is the number of recurring task to be tracked
> If `REPEAT_PERIOD` is not entered as a number [repeat REPEAT_PERIOD] will be ignored

Examples:
* `add Homework from 24 sep 8pm to 25 sep 9pm tag/CS1231`
* `add Homework from  24 sep 7.15pm to 25 sep 9pm daily repeat 4 t/CS1231`
* `add Homework from today 8.03pm to 8.15pm t/CS1231`
	<img src="images/ug_add_fromto_date_before.PNG" width="600">
	<img src="images/ug_add_fromto_date_after.PNG" width="600">
* `add Homework from 26 oct 10am to 11am daily repeat 3`
	<img src="images/ug_add_fromto_date_recurring_before.PNG" width="600">
	<img src="images/ug_add_fromto_date_recurring_after.PNG" width="600">

#### Select tasks : `select`
Format: select TASK_ID

> If TASK_ID is more than or less than the task present in the task list
> it is invalid.

Examples:
* `select 1`
