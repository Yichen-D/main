The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how Happy Jim Task Master handles undo request from user.

> Note that the context is a class that stores previous task master in the previous model before the target command executes.

The _Class Diagram_ below shows the structure of how Happy Jim Task Master implements undo and redo operations.

<img src="images/URManager.jpg" width="600"><br>

> Note that LogicManager maintains an URManager. UR manager contains two ArrayDeque, one for undo and the other for redo,  
> to store the command and its context, specifically, the model before the command executes. 
> To undo/redo a command, it is just to  restore the previous model (specifically, the data, which is TaskMaster). 
> As a result, as the task master grows, the consumption of memory to store the context grows. 
> To maintain a good performance regarding to memory consumption, we restrict maximum undo/redo number to 3.
> (Noted that it is possible to reach unlimited undo/redo by simply wiping off the limit number.)

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.
   
   Currently, _Systems Tests_ have covered the basic functionalities of Happy Jim Task Master v0.4. 
   Following form shows the some of the essential commands and corresponding testcases.
   
   1. _AddCommandTest_ 
   
   
   | Case# | Event | Basis Path | Output |
   | :---:   | ---  | --- | ---  |
   | 1 | add floating task to existing task list `add eat with Hoon Meier` | 1 -> 2 | `New floating task added: eat with Hoon Meier Tags: ` |
   | 2 | add floating task to existing task list  `add play with Ida Mueller` | 1 -> 2 | `New floating task added: play with Ida Mueller Tags: ` |
   | 3 | add duplicate floating task to existing task master `add eat with Hoon Meier` | 1 | `This task already exists in the task list` |
   | 4 | clear existing task list `clear` | 1 -> 2 | `Task list  has been cleared!` |
   | 5 | add to empty task list `add take trash t/notUrgent` | 1 -> 2 | `New floating task added: take trash Tags: [notUrgent]` |
   | 6 | invalid add command `adds Johnny` | 1 | `Unknown command` |
   
   2. _ClearCommandTest_ 
   
   
   | Case# | Event | Basis Path | Output |
   | :---:   | ---  | :---: | ---  |
   | 1 | clear existing non-empty task list `clear` | 1 -> 2 | `Task list has been cleared!` |
   | 2 | verify other commands can work after task list cleared `add eat with Hoon Meier` | 1 -> 2 | `New floating task added: eat with Hoon Meier Tags: ` |
   | 3 | add duplicate floating task `delete 1` | 1 -> 2| `Deleted Task: eat with Hoon Meier Tags: ` |
   | 4 | verify clear command works when the list is empty `clear` | 1 -> 2 | `Task list has been cleared!` |
   
   3. _CommandBoxTest_
   
   
   | Case# | Event | Basis Path | Output |
   | :---:   | ---  | :---: | ---  |
   | 1 | command succeeds text cleared `add read book t/textBook t/weekly` | 1 -> 2 | `This task already exists in the task list` |
   | 2 | command fails text stays `invalid command` | 1 | `Unknown Command` |
   
   4. _DeleteCommandTest_
   
   
   | Case# | Event | Basis Path | Output |
   | :---:   | ---  | :---: | ---  |
   | 1 | delete the first in the list `delete 1` | 1 -> 2 | `Deleted Task: take trash Tags: [notUrgent]` |
   | 2 | delete the last in the list `delete 6` | 1 -> 2 | `Deleted Task: visit George Best Tags: ` |
   | 3 | delete from the middle of the list `delete 2` | 1 -> 2 | `Deleted Task: do homework Tags: ` |
   | 4 | delete with invalid index `delete 51` | 1 | `The task index provided is invalid` |
   
   5. _FindCommandTest_ 
   
   
   | Case# | Event | Basis Path | Output |
   | :---:   | ---  | :---: | ---  |
   | 1 | find in non-empty list with no results `find Mark` | 1 -> 2 | `0 tasks listed!` |
   | 2 | find in non-empty list with multiple results `find read` | 1 -> 2 | `2 tasks listed!` |
   | 3 | delete one result `delete 1` | 1 -> 2 | `Deleted Task: read book Tags: [textBook][weekly]` |
   | 4 | find in non-empty list with one result `find read` | 1 -> 2 | `1 tasks listed!` |
   | 5 | find in empty list `find Jean` | 1 -> 2 | `0 tasks listed!` |
   | 6 | invalid find command `findgeorge` | 1 | `Unknown command` |

      Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as 
      how the are connected together. Below are some snippets,<br>
      e.g. `seedu.taskmaster.logic.LogicManagerTest`<br>
      In the `LogicManagerTest`, Happy Jim Task Master tests the logic it uses.<br>
      Typically, Happy Jim Task Master focuses on some boundary tests.<br>
	  e.g. To `find` a task, for instance, `Test Task 1 by 20 oct 11am `,<br>
      try execute <br>
      *`find by 20 oct 11am` --> exact boundary, task found;<br>
      *`find by 20 oct 10.59am` --> smaller boundary, lists nothing;<br>
      *`find by 20 oct 11.01am` --> lax boundary, task found.<br>
      > Note that this is a test not merely for `logic`, but also `parser` and `model`.<br>
